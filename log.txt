| | | | |     Fixed bugs + added features

| | | | |     -Buttons now have a delay.
| | | | |     -Fixed issue with buttons when delay is used.
| | | | |     -On incorrect attempt the canvas will go to the ready state (skips the start button).
| | | | |     -Cleaned code.
| | | | |     -Added new function that is responsible for hiding and showing buttons called "change_button()".
| | | | |     -Click with same colour to delete functionality is back!
| | | | |     -Drag colouring no longer interferes with delete to click functionality.
| | | | |     -maybe more changes I've forgotten.

| | | | |     Organised files
| | | | |     
| | | | |     Tim gave approval for splitting files, so now we have much cleaner files and code.
| | | | |     - Each html file has it's own CSS and JavaScript files where relevant.
| | | | |     - Created a new CSS file "global.css", which is applied to all files, or at least it should be.
| | | | |     - Updated all HTML files so that they extract what they need from the new locations.

| | | |       Puzzle remembers correct cells
| | | |       
| | | |       - User can no longer interact with the canvas unless ready is selected.
| | | |       - When user gets the puzzle wrong, the cells the user got correct are remembered.
| | | |       - It's now possible to do harder puzzles!
| | | |       - Puzzle is now 7x7 to make it difficult.

| | | |     Attempted update to most recent version
| | | |     
| | | |     -Placed login page background in picture folder.
| | | |     -Merged login.js and javascript.js, everything in login.js is now in javascript.js.
| | | |     -Merged login.css and stylesheet.css, everything in login.css is now in stylesheet.css.
| | | |     -Added retro font to login page.
| | | |     -Login page now has an id in its body to distinguish it's css from other pages.
| | | |     -href of nav bars now point to the web pages we currently have. e.g. Clicking about takes the user to about.html.
| | | |     -A lot  of inline (onclick) javascript in the HTML files, I changed some but others also need to be changed to event listeners to modularise our project.
| | | |     -CSS of login page, needs to be fixed to work with the new font style. Also needs to feel more retro.
| | | |     -Need to change javascript, so it only loads the initializations for particular pages. E.g. DailyPuzzle's JS won't look for the canvas id when in the login page.
| | | |     -Merged Dhwani's button rework with most recent version, removed inline javascript in dailypuzzle.html. Added them to the click event listeners for the buttons.
| | | |     -Dhwani's CSS could be reduced, some statements could be merged, simplifying the code and reducing clutter.
| | | |     -probably some other minor changes I've forgotten.

| | | | | 
| | | | |     Added next puzzle functionality
| | | | |

| | | | |     - When you fail the puzzle you can try again until you get it right.
| | | | |     - Currently removed QMARK for testing purposes.
| | | | |     - All supporting functions are in snake_case.
| | | | |     - renamed a few variables to make it easier to read.
| | | | |     - Added more supporting functions.
| | | | |     - Possibly more.

| | | |     CSS changes + QMARK
| | | |     
| | | |     -Looks nicer.
| | | |     -Added visual indication of game not start, start, ready, and win.
| | | |     -Added a question mark when the user hasn't pressed start.
| | | |     -Increased canvas size to 7x7 (any size smaller then this, a legible question mark can't be drawn).
| | | |     -Updated the question mark so it's works for a 7x7 canvas (question mark before only worked for a 16x16 canvas).
| | | |     -Hints needed to solve puzzles greater then 3x3. If you want to lower the grid size (for testing check or some other reason) make sure to replace QMARK in the initialization section to {} (empty dictionary).

| | | |     -Comprehensive about page CSS added.
| | | |     -Daily Puzzle page updated to suit Retro feel.
| | | |     -Currently puzzle before start is pressed is nothing, question mark to be added.

| | | |       Merge pull request #4 from Haxinator/amir
| | | |       
| | | |       Merging Amir's work
| | | |       Amir added:
| | | |       
| | | |       a ready button, which clears canvas on ready.
| | | |       a start button which showed the puzzle for the user to copy.
| | | |       a check button which checks if the user canvas matches the puzzle.
| | | |       a sample puzzle and question mark.
| | | |       a draw function which draws a predefined puzzle.
| | | |       Possibly more that I've forgotten.
| | | |       
| | | |       I added:
| | | |       
| | | |       Bug fixes to the check function.
| | | |       Updated code to merge with Will's.
| | | |       Changed sample puzzles to Will's color pallet.
| | | |       Merged some of Amir's functions with Will's.
| | | |       Changed variable and function names to those that I believe make more sense.
| | | |       Updated Amir's code to work with current version of main.
| | | |       More that I can't be bothered rewriting, check Amir's branch to see more changes.
| | | |       
| | | |       Additionally adding Amir's new updates to the check function and his implementation of user feedback.
